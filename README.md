# Comparative Protein Structure Modeling: SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) 🦠💻

## Overview

This repository contains the prediction results from two major computational tools, **SWISS-MODEL** (Homology Modeling) and **I-TASSER** (Threading/Ab Initio Hybrid), used to model the 3D structure of the **SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase (Mpro/NSP5)**. Mpro is a vital antiviral drug target, and this analysis compares high-quality models generated by different state-of-the-art platforms.

The target sequence for both models is the full Mpro protein (306 residues), labeled `>7LYH_1|Chain A...mutated.fasta` in the SWISS-MODEL report.

## Comparative Modeling Summary

Both modeling approaches yielded high-confidence structures, which is expected due to the abundance of highly similar experimental templates for Mpro.

| Metric | SWISS-MODEL (Homology) | I-TASSER (Hybrid) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | `7LYHmodel_01.pdb` | `model_1.pdb` (from I-TASSER results) |
| **Prediction Method** | Homology (Template-based) | Threading/Ab Initio |
| **Key Template Identity** | **99.67%** (PDB ID 9du3) | Consistently high ($>90\%$) |
| **SWISS-MODEL GMQE** | **0.97** (Excellent) | N/A |
| **I-TASSER C-score** | N/A | [Check I-TASSER results and insert C-score] |
| **Predicted Oligo-State** | **Homo-dimer** (Matches biological unit) | Homo-dimer (likely) |

### Key Files and Quality

* **7LYHmodel\_01.pdb:** SWISS-MODEL's structure prediction (high confidence, near experimental quality).
* **I-TASSER results.pdf:** Shows the five top models generated by I-TASSER, which can be compared for consistency.

## Setup and Visualization

To visualize the predicted structures and analyze their differences:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```

2.  **View 3D Structure:**
    Load the **`7LYHmodel_01.pdb`** file into any molecular visualization software (e.g., **PyMOL** or **ChimeraX**).

3.  **Comparative Analysis:**
    * Compare the SWISS-MODEL's predicted conformation against the top models reported in the **`I-TASSER results.pdf`** to assess the structural consensus.
    * Open the **`report.html`** in a web browser for detailed local quality analysis.
